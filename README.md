# kotlin-playground
Kotlin Android samples/template project

This project is basically a repo of Kotlin Android Samples to support my [Kotlin Playground Series](https://medium.com/@jcmsalves/kotlin-playground-aab8be8ac432 "Kotlin Playground") on Medium. The goal with the series is that at the end we either have a new nice kotlin template project or just a bunch of useful samples that people can easily pick up.

The idea is that the project grows with each article published so I'll tag each article release with article_# in the repo so it's easier to access the code for each article.

If you have any cool ideas or suggestions feel free to open issues in the repo and I'll try to address in a future article.
