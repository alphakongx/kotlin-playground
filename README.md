# kotlin-playground
Kotlin Android samples/template project

The goal with the series is that at the end we either have a new nice kotlin template project or just a bunch of useful samples that people can easily pick up.

The idea is that the project grows with each article published so I'll tag each article release with article_# in the repo so it's easier to access the code for each article.
